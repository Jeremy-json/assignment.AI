            <h4 style="font-weight: 400;">
              Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
              These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems are designed to mimic human cognitive functions and adapt to new situations by analyzing and interpreting data. 
              AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems, among others. 
              AI has a wide range of applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, and it continues to advance rapidly, shaping the future of technology and society.

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Supervised Data Model</h2>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 400;">
              A supervised data model is a type of machine learning model where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.           
              Labeled data consists of input-output pairs, where the input data is accompanied by the correct output or target label. During the training process, the algorithm learns to map input data to the correct output by adjusting its parameters based on the error between the predicted output and the actual label.
              Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data by generalizing the patterns learned during training. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression, where the goal is to predict discrete categories or continuous values, respectively
              n supervised learning, the performance of the model is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict the correct output for new, unseen data. Common evaluation metrics for supervised learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC)

            <h4 style="font-weight: 400;">
              Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence the term "deep"). 
              These neural networks are designed to learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms are capable of automatically learning hierarchical representations of data, 
              where each layer of the network extracts increasingly abstract features from the input data. 
              This ability to automatically learn features makes deep learning models highly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
